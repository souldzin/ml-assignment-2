# ML Assignment 2

This is Assignment 2 for our ML class.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the data from the instructor
3. Move the data into the "data" folder in this repository

Git will ignore any changes to the "data" folder.

We will need to make sure our test scripts can receive file paths for the testing and training. The professor is expecting us to read from the current directory, while we'll be working off of data in the "data" directory.
