# ML Assignment 2

This is Assignment 2 for our ML class.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a "data" folder in this repository
3. Download the data .zip from the instructor
4. Extract the data .zip 
5. Move the data files into the "data" folder of this repository

Git will ignore any changes to the "data" folder.

We will need to make sure our test scripts can receive file paths for the testing and training. The professor is expecting us to read from the current directory, while we'll be working off of data in the "data" directory.
